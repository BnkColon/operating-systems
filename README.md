Algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing

1. [FIFO](https://github.com/BnkColon/operating-systems/blob/master/fifo.py), first in first out is a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first
2. [SJF](https://github.com/BnkColon/operating-systems/blob/master/sjf.py), shortest job first, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
3. [RR](https://github.com/BnkColon/operating-systems/blob/master/rr.py), Round Robin - time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
