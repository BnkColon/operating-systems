Algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing

1. first in, first out (FIFO) - a method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer, where the oldest (first) entry, or 'head' of the queue, is processed first
2. shortest job first (SJF) - is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
3. Round Robin (RR) -  time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority
